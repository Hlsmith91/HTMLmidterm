        <h2>What is Cubism?</h2>

        <p>Started by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, most Cubist works are immediately recognizable due to their flattened, nearly two-dimensional appearance; an inclusion of geometric angles, lines, and shapes; and a fairly neutral color palette.</p>
        <p>As the movement evolved, color, texture, and graphic elements (like text) were added, to the point where later Cubist works often appeared more like collage than anything else. But Cubism wasn’t just a specific “style” or “look”—it actually allowed artists an entirely different way of seeing and depicting real-life objects.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional still-lifes, landscapes, or portrait paintings, Cubist paintings aren’t meant to be realistic or life-like in any way. Instead, after looking at the subject from every possibly angle, the artist will piece together fragments from different vantage points into one painting.</p>
        <p>In doing this, the artist is attempting to give a fuller, more detailed explanation of the subject—breaking past barriers of space and time, like in the famous painting by Marcel Duchamp entitled Nude Descending a Staircase </p>
        <p>This type of Cubism is called Analytic Cubism, and it’s usually what comes to mind when people think of Cubist artwork.</p>
        <p>Synthetic Cubism on the other hand was a natural extension of Analytic Cubism. Instead of breaking a subject down into pieces, it involved assembling pieces already available into a collage.</p>
